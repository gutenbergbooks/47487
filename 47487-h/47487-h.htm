cardinals, the longspurs, and the buntings,
belong to that large family of perching
birds called the Fringillidae, from the
Latin word Fringilla, meaning a finch.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman tells us, in his &ldquo;Birds
of Eastern North America,&rdquo; that &ldquo;this,
the largest family of birds, contains some
five hundred and fifty species, which are
represented in all parts of the world, except
the Australian region. Its members
present a wide diversity of form and habit,
but generally agree in possessing stout,
conical bills, which are admirably adapted
to crush seeds. They are thus chief
among seed-eaters, and for this reason
are not so migratory as insect-eating
species.&rdquo; Many of the birds most
highly prized for the cage and as songsters
are representatives of this family and
many of the species are greatly admired
for their beautiful coloring. The White-Winged
Crossbill is a native of the northern
part of North America, migrating
southward into the United States during
the winter months. Its technical name,
Loxia leucoptera, is most appropriate and
descriptive. The generic name Loxia
is derived from the Greek loxos, meaning
crosswise or slanting, and the specific
name leucoptera is from two Greek
works, meaning white and wing, and has
reference to the white tips of the feathers
of the wings. The common name, Crossbill,
or, as the bird is sometimes called,
Crossbeak, describes the peculiar structure
of the bill which marks them as perhaps
the most peculiar of our song birds.
The bill is quite deeply cut at the base and
compressed near the tips of the two parts,
which are quite abruptly bent, one upward
and the other downward, so that
the points cross at an angle of about forty-five
degrees. This characteristic gives
this bird a parrot-like appearance. The
similarity is heightened by the fact that
these hook-like bills are used by the birds
to assist in climbing from branch to
branch.</p>
<p>The Crossbills are even parrot-like in
captivity. Dr. Ridgway, in the &ldquo;Ornithology
of Illinois,&rdquo; writes as follows regarding
the habits of a pair: &ldquo;They were
very tame, and were exceedingly interesting
little pets. Their movements in the
cage were like those of caged parrots in
every respect, except that they were far
more easy and rapid. They clung to the
sides and upper wires of the cage with
their feet, hung down from them, and
seemed to enjoy the practice of walking
with their head downward. They were
in full song, and both the male and female
were quite good singers. Their
songs were irregular and varied, but
sweet and musical. They ate almost every
kind of food, but were especially eager
for slices of raw apple. Although while
they lived they were continually bickering
over their food, yet when the female was
accidentally choked by a bit of egg shell
her mate was inconsolable, ceased to sing,
refused his food, and died of grief in a
very few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their peculiar bills are especially fitted
for obtaining their food, which consists to
a great extent of the seeds of cone-bearing
trees, such as the pine, the hemlock
and the spruce. The ornithologist Wilson
says: &ldquo;On first glancing at the bill
of this extraordinary bird one is apt to
pronounce it deformed and monstrous;
but, on attentively observing the use to
which it is applied by the owner and the
dexterity with which he detaches the
seeds of the pine-tree from the cone and
from the husks that inclose them, we are
obliged to confess on this, as on many
other occasions where we have judged
too hastily of the operations of nature,
that no other conformation could have
been so excellently adapted to the purpose;
and that its deviation from the common
form, instead of being a defect or
monstrosity as the celebrated French naturalist
insinuates, is a striking proof of
the wisdom of the great Creator.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. F. M. WOODRUFF.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>As an accidental malformation this
structure of the bill has been noted among
other birds, and, it is said, with some frequency
among the crows. A mediaeval
legend gives as the cause for this conformation
of the bill and the red color of
the plumage that it was acquired &ldquo;in recognition
of the pity it bestowed on the
suffering Savior at the Crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably due to the nature of their
food, which can usually be procured in
any season, these birds are apparently not
under the control of the usual laws that
govern migration, but wander about in
a seemingly aimless manner and are not
influenced to any great extent by the
changing seasons. They do not seem to
be a constant inhabitant of any given locality
for any length of time, but appear
and disappear as if constantly dissatisfied
with their surroundings.</p>
<p>The two sexes vary in color, the body
of the male being a dull carmine-red, which
is brighter on the rump, and that of the
female is brownish, tinged with olive-green
and with brownish yellow on the
rump. The young males are similar in
color to the females, but pass through a
changeable plumage while maturing.</p>
<p>The Crossbill usually builds its nest in
a cone-bearing tree and does not always
choose the most inconspicuous locality.
The nest is generally constructed of
rather coarse twigs and strips of birch or
cedar bark and lichens. This is lined
with hair, the softer fibers of bark, fine
rootlets, grass and feathers. The whole
nest is saucer-shaped and about four
inches in diameter, outside measurement,
by one and one-half in depth. Authorities
tell us that the eggs are usually three in
number. In color they are a pale blue,
nearly spotless at the smaller end, but at
the larger end marked with irregular
streaks or dots of lavender or reddish-brown.
The eggs are small, about eight-tenths
of an inch long by nearly six-tenths
in diameter.</p>
<p>On account of their vagrant habits,
Dr. Brehm was wont to call them the
&ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo; among birds. While seeking
food or flying from place to place, they
continually utter a plaintive note and
their song is soft and sweet.</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE STUDY OF BACTERIA.</h2>
<p>The bacteriologist is working in a
wonderland fully as remote to the average
mind as that ever occupied by the astronomer
or psychologist; and yet it is
as real to him as though he were walking
through a forest and noting the different
kinds of trees. Such popular doubts as
have been held regarding bacteriology
and even the existence of bacteria are no
longer justified. The evidence is too
overwhelming not to be accepted by anyone
who has sufficient interest to investigate.
The methods used in bacteriologic
studies are to-day giving us information
fully as concise as that obtained by the
general botanist in the study of higher
plants. Indeed, the phenomena of bacterial
activities and the chemistry of the
products of growth of many species of
bacteria have already received attention
not equaled in the study of some of our
most useful plants.</p>
<p>Bacteria are plants; not because of any
absolute characteristic that separates them
from animals, but because comparative
study shows that they are more like
plants than animals. They are single-celled
organisms and each individual has
the prime factors of life, assimilation,
growth and reproduction. Each bacterium
is an independent cell and although
the cells in some species remain
attached to one another, giving rise to
characteristic groupings, they are mostly
detached and free individuals. Bacteria
can increase in numbers to a remarkable
extent when favorable conditions exist.
The mother-cell simply splits into two
daughter-cells and these form a generation
of four cells, while later generations,
consisting of perhaps one million cells,
can in fifteen or twenty minutes produce
two million bacteria. But conditions
must be favorable for this active growth,
ample food stuffs, free from other bacteria,
together with moisture and reasonable
warmth are most essential. There
are many circumstances constantly at
work to prevent an overgrowth of bacteria;
exhaustion of food supply, antagonism
of species and fresh air with sunshine,
are the most important. Bacteria
are present everywhere in greater or less
numbers, except within the bodies of
healthy, growing plants and animals. It is
for this reason that bacteria become so active
and multiply with great rapidity
when once established in the tissue fluids
of larger organisms, either before or after
they have died. Vital activities during
health prevent the entrance of bacteria
into our bodies. There are, however,
times when the association of different
species of bacteria and also the association
of bacteria with higher plants is of
mutual advantage. The association of decomposition
and pathogenic bacteria frequently
makes it possible for the latter to
infect an animal, when alone it perhaps
would not take place. Again, the growth of
certain bacteria within the root-structure
of plants greatly improves their functional
activity. The leguminous plants are enabled
to assimilate much larger quantities
of nitrogen when associated with bacteria
than when growing alone. No such
mutually advantageous relationships are
known to exist between bacteria and animals;
the tendencies are rather destructive,
leading to the infectious diseases.
The general biologic function of the bacteria
is very important and in a general
way the need of their existence can be
much better appreciated than that of
many living beings. Decomposition may
be stated as being their chief functional
activity. Decomposition stands before
life; without it the progress of the generations
would terminate. The gradual and
ever rapid disappearance of the substance
of vegetable and animal bodies after
death makes room for growing life. With
an absence of decomposition the bodies
of plants and animals would collect on
the earth and cover it so deeply with organic
matter that plants in particular would
be entirely unable to obtain requisite
nourishment. Higher plants having
chlorophyll are able to feed on inorganic
material, while bacteria require organic
matter to sustain life. Bacterial food is
then derived from the higher forms of
life, while these higher forms feed on the
end products of bacterial decomposition,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
with the addition of salts from the earth.
An evolutionary query might then arise
as to the early conditions in the history of
organic life on the earth. It is certainly a
fertile field for the theorist. Accepting
the general rule that simplicity of structure
indicates priority, what then was the
food supply of the primordial bacterium
before the advent of higher plants to supply
requisite organic matter? We can
hardly believe that there was already in
existence sufficient ammonia-bearing
compounds of suitable quality to sustain
these lowest organisms until evolutionary
conditions added organisms having the
capacity of collecting nitrogen and carbon
from purely inorganic sources.
These general facts, as we now see them,
would apparently strengthen the thought
that different kinds of organisms became
extant at the same time.</p>
<p>The methods used in bacteriologic
study are based on a few very distinct
principles. Successful cultivation of bacteria
depends upon a knowledge of sterilization,
preparation of culture media and
isolation of species. It is in fact miniature
gardening. A rod of platinum wire
is the trowel and this is kept clean and
free from undesirable organisms by heating
it red hot in the gas flame. With it
bacteria are lifted from tube or plate. The
culture media required are mostly beef-tea
and gelatine mixtures and are prepared
with extreme care as to their composition
and reaction. The decomposition
of the culture medium is prevented by
keeping it in test tubes or flasks plugged
with cotton and sterilized by boiling. By
means of the cotton plug the air passing
in and out of the tube is filtered and the
bacteria floating in the air are caught in
the cotton and cannot get into the tube.
It also prevents bacteria from the culture
getting out of the tube and spreading infectious
material. Each test tube represents
a little greenhouse, but one that is
free from all life; it is sterile when ready
for use. To the media or culture soils in
the tubes the bacteria are transplanted
with the platinum rod, and active growth
is obtained by placing the tubes in a suitable
temperature. Such a growth of bacteria
in a test tube can contain many
millions of bacteria, while the resulting
appearance of growth is due to the heaping
up of the individuals. To the naked
eye the cells are invisible, but the mass is
recognized in the same way that one
would know a field of wheat in the distance
without being able to see each separate
plant. Species of bacteria are separated
by distributing a few organisms
throughout a fluid and then planting upon
solid media. The individual cells then
grow in place and produce colonies.
These are separate and distinct to the
eye and each contains bacteria, all of the
same kind. From colonies transplantations
to tube cultures are made, and the
species is propagated on different media.
The observations from such growths, together
with the microscopical study and
sometimes inoculation experiments on
animals are the data by which the species
is recognized. Microscopic methods, although
somewhat complicated have been
so far developed that some species of bacteria
can be as promptly recognized under
the microscope as an acquaintance
met upon the street.</p>
<p>Bacteriology is now being studied and
investigated as a field of research in hundreds
of laboratories, and in every university
in Europe and America. Bacteriology
has added as much to man&rsquo;s wealth
and happiness as any of the applied
sciences. All the methods of preservation
of food depend upon bacteriological
principles, while modern sanitary science
is based on the recognition of the cause
of infectious diseases. The presence of
specific bacteria in the secretions or
tissues of man and animals is now such a
certainty for many diseases that the work
of making bacteriologic diagnoses is in
itself an extensive vocation. Within the
next few years every city in America will
have a diagnosis laboratory for infectious
diseases. We can safely predict that the
trained bacteriologist will be called upon
to stand between each sick person or animal
and the community to direct measures
that will prevent infection of others.
Hygienists are learning more every day
as to the exact way in which disease bacteria
pass from person to person, and the
reasons for the occurrence of diseases.
They have learned that the accidental and
unusual circumstance is least important,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
but that there is a regular train of cause
and effect, and in the knowledge of how
to break this chain is the key to the
proper control of an epidemic. Veterinary
medicine has been able to obtain
benefits from bacteriology much beyond
those already so important to human
medicine. This is so because of the
persistent prejudice opposed to bacteriology
in medicine, while the veterinarian
has been allowed to treat his patients
practically as the experiment animals are
treated in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Bacteriologists are frequently meeting
demands made of their science that are
beyond its present stage of progress. It
is frequently forgotten that this is biology
whose deductions are always subject to
the variation of growing things, and not
chemistry or mathematics, with their definite
determinations and strict limitations.
Bacteriology is now an established
science, and it is as competent to render
service in due proportion to its development
and with the same integrity as any
biological subject. There are now many
known facts in bacteriology that cannot
be made useful because intermediate
steps in their study have not been learned.
It will require long series of experiments
in some cases, but when added to the
present usefulness of bacteriology the results
may be expected to satisfy the most
severe critics.</p>

<h2 id="c6">THE TOWNSEND&rsquo;S WARBLER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Dendroica townsendi.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Robert Ridgway, in the Ornithology
of Illinois, uses the following words
in speaking of that family of birds called
the American Warblers (Mniotilidae),
&ldquo;No group of birds more deserves the
epithet of pretty than the Warblers; Tanagers
are splendid; Humming-birds are
refulgent; other kinds are brilliant, gaudy
or magnificent, but Warblers alone are
pretty in the proper and full sense of that
term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they are full of nervous activity, and
are &ldquo;eminently migratory birds,&rdquo; they
seem to flit rather than fly through the
United States as they pass northward in
the spring to their breeding places, and
southward in the fall to their winter homes
among the luxuriant forests and plantations
of the tropics. All the species are
purely American, and as they fly from
one extreme to the other of their migratory
range they remain but a few days in
any intermediate locality. Time seems
to be an important matter with them. It
would seem as if every moment of daylight
was used in the gathering of food
and the night hours in continuing their
journey.</p>
<p>The American Warblers include more
than one hundred species grouped in
about twenty genera. Of these species
nearly three-fourths are represented in
North America at least as summer visitants,
the remaining species frequenting
only the tropics. Though woodland
birds they exhibit many and widely separated
modes of life, some of the species
preferring only aquatic regions, while
others seek drier soils. Some make their
homes in shrubby places, while others are
seldom found except in forests. As their
food is practically confined to insects,
they frequent our lawns and orchards
during their migrations, when they fly in
companies which may include several
species. Mr. Chapman, in his Handbook
of Birds of Eastern North America, says,
&ldquo;Some species flit actively from branch to
branch, taking their prey from the more
exposed parts of the twigs and leaves;
others are gleaners, and carefully explore
the under surfaces of leaves or crevices in
the bark; while several, like Flycatchers,
capture a large part of their food on the
wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Townsend&rsquo;s Warbler is a native of
Western North America, especially near
the Pacific coast. Its range extends from
Sitka on the north to Central America on
the south, where it appears during the
winter. In its migration it wanders as far
east as Colorado. It breeds from the
southern border of the United States
northward, nesting in regions of cone-bearing
trees. It is said that the nest of
this Warbler is usually placed at a considerable
height, though at times as low
as from five to fifteen feet from the
ground. The nest is built of strips of
fibrous bark, twigs, long grasses and
wool, compactly woven together. This is
lined with hair, vegetable down and
feathers.</p>
<p>The eggs are described as buffy white,
speckled and spotted with reddish brown
and lilac-gray, about three-fifths of an
inch in length by about one-half of an
inch in diameter.</p>

<h2 id="c7">THE STORY OF SOME BLACK BUGS.</h2>
<p>We were going to visit Aunt Bessie, and
John and I like few things better than
that. To begin with, she lives in the
country, and there is always so much to
do in the way of fun that the days never
seem half long enough.</p>
<p>Then, besides, Aunt Bessie knows
everything, and can tell such famous
stories. So when she asked us one morning
to go to the pond with her and see
something interesting, you may be sure
we were not slow in following her.</p>
<p>The rushes grew thickly along the
sides, but the water was clear, and we
could plainly see the black bugs she
pointed out to us crawling, slowly and
clumsily, over the muddy bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those things!&rdquo; said John, not a little
disgusted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they are much.
Are they tadpoles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tadpoles!&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Why, whoever
saw tadpoles with six legs and no
tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The absence of a tail is very convincing,&rdquo;
laughed Aunt Bessie. &ldquo;They are
certainly not tadpoles. Now watch them
closely, please, and tell me all about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are abominably ugly. That is
one thing,&rdquo; broke in John. &ldquo;They look
black, and have six legs. But how funny
their skin is. More like a crust, or lots
of crusts laid one on the other. They are
about the stupidest things I ever saw.
They seem to do nothing but crawl over
that mud and&mdash;Hello! they aren&rsquo;t so stupid,
after all. Did you see that fellow
snatch a poor fly and gobble him up
quicker than you could say Jack Robinson?
And there&rsquo;s another taken a mosquito
just as quick. I&rsquo;ll take back what I
said about the slow business. But really,
Auntie, do you think them very interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you that question when you
have learned something more about
them,&rdquo; was her answer. &ldquo;Tell me now
what you think of that Dragon-fly darting
over the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is a beauty,&rdquo; we answered in a
breath. &ldquo;But please let us hear something
about those things down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day, boys. I wish you to see
something for yourselves first. Watch
here for a few days and your patience will
be rewarded, I promise you. Then I will
have a story to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that Auntie never spoke without
reason, so John and I kept a close
watch on those bugs. For two days nothing
happened. The old things just crawled
over the mud or ate flies and mosquitoes,
as usual.</p>
<p>But the third day one big fellow decided
to try something new. It was nothing
less than to creep up the stem of one
of the rushes. I suppose it was hard
work, for he took a long time to get to
the surface of the water. Here he stopped
a while and then seemed to make up his
mind to go further. Soon he was quite
out of the water and could breathe all the
air and sunshine he wished. I believe he
did not like it very well. He seemed so
restless and uneasy. I was expecting to
see him go back, when I heard John cry
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! oh, do look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did look, and could scarcely believe
my eyes.</p>
<p>His skin (the bug&rsquo;s, I mean), was actually
cracking right down the back, just
as though the air and sunshine had dried
it too much.</p>
<p>Poor fellow, he seemed in great trouble
about it. Then, to make matters
worse, a part of his coat broke off at the
top and slipped down over his eyes, so
that he could not see. After a moment,
however, it dropped further, quite under
the place where his chin would have been,
had he had a chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he is getting a new face. A prettier
one, too, I am glad to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if John was always first to
notice things, for it was just as he said;
as the old face slipped away a new one
came in its place.</p>
<p>I guess that by this time that old bug
was as much astonished as we were. He
was wriggling about in a very strange
fashion, and at last quite wriggled himself
out of his old shell. Then we saw two
pairs of wings, which must have been
folded away in little cases by his side, begin
to open like fans. Next, he stretched
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
his legs, and it was easy to see that they
were longer and more beautiful than
those he had had before.</p>
<p>Then, before we could admire his slender,
graceful body, or fully realize the
wonderful change that had occurred in
him, he darted away before our astonished
eyes, not a black bug, but a beautiful
Dragon-fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; we both shouted. The next
second we were rushing at top speed to
tell Auntie all about it; just as though she
had not known all along what was going
to happen.</p>
<p>She listened and then told us what we
did not know.</p>
<p>How months before the mother Dragon-fly
had dropped her tiny eggs in the
water, where they hatched out the black
bugs, which were so unlike their mother
that she did not know them for her children,
and had no word to say to them
during the long hours she spent in skimming
over the water where they lived.</p>
<p>These bugs were content at first to live
in the mud. But soon came the longing
for sun and air. And then followed the
wonderful transformation from an ugly
black bug to the beautiful dragon-fly.</p>
<p>If you will go beside some pond in the
spring or early summer, and find among
the water grasses such a bug as I have
described, and will then watch long
enough you will see just what John and
I saw. Afterwards I am sure you will
agree with us that it is very wonderful
indeed.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE SOLITARY SANDPIPER.</h2>
<p>He is a curious little chap, the Solitary
Snipe, and we used to call him Tip-up.
He delights to &ldquo;see-saw&rdquo; and &ldquo;teeter&rdquo;
down a clay bank, with a tiny &ldquo;peep-po,&rdquo;
&ldquo;peep-po,&rdquo; just before he pokes in his
long, slender bill for food.</p>
<p>He is very tough, and possesses as
many lives as the proverbial cat. I have
taken many a shot at him&mdash;fine sand-shot
at that&mdash;and from a gun with a record for
scattering, and I never succeeded in
knocking over but one Tip-up while on a
hunt for taxidermy specimens. I failed
to secure even this one, though he flopped
over in the water and floated down upon
the surface of the shallows toward where I
stood, knee-deep awaiting his coming. He
was as dead as any bird should have been
after such a peppering; yes, he was my
prize at last, or so I thought as I reached
out my hand to lift his limp-looking little
body from the water. He was only playing
possum after all. With a whirl of his
wings and a shrill &ldquo;peep-po,&rdquo; &ldquo;peep-po,&rdquo;
he darted away and disappeared up stream
and out of sight beyond the alders. To
add to my disappointment a red-headed
woodpecker began to pound out a tantalizing
tune upon the limb of a dead
hemlock. No sand-shot could reach that
fellow, desire him as much as I might.
Then a bold kingfisher, with a shrill,
saucy scream, darted down before me,
grabbed a dace and sailed to a branch opposite
to enjoy his feast, well knowing,
the rascal! that I had an unloaded gun
and had fired my last shell. How he knew
this I am not able to say, but he did.
Wiser fellows in bird lore than I may be
able to explain this. I cannot.</p>
<p>The Solitary Sandpiper is well named.
He is always at home wherever found,
and always travels alone, be it upon the
shelving rock-banks of a river or the
clay-banks of a rural stream. He possesses,
after a fashion, the gift of the
chameleon and can moderately change
the color of his coat, or feathers, rather.
When he &ldquo;teeters&rdquo; along a blue clay bank
he looks blue, and when he &ldquo;see-saws&rdquo;
along brown or gray rocks he looks gray
or brown, as the case may be.</p>
<p>The city boy who spends his vacation
in the rural parts and fishes for dace, redfins
or sunfish, knows the Solitary Sandpiper.
To the country boy he is an old
acquaintance, for he has taken many a
shot, with stone or stick, at the spry little
Tip-up, who never fails to escape scot
free to &ldquo;peep-po,&rdquo; &ldquo;peep-po&rdquo; at his sweet
content.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE KNOT OR ROBIN SNIPE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Tringa canutus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Knot or Robin Snipe is a bird of
several names, as it is also called the Red-breasted
Ash-colored Sandpiper, the
Gray-back and the Gray Snipe. It is
quite cosmopolitan, breeding in the far
north of both hemispheres, but in winter
migrating southward and wintering in the
climate of the southern United States
and Central America. The Knot belongs
to the Snipe family (Scolopacidae), which
includes one hundred or more species,
about forty-five of which are inhabitants
of North America. Nearly all the species
breed in the higher latitudes of the northern
hemisphere. These birds frequent
the shores of large bodies of water and
are seldom observed far from their vicinity.
Their bills are long and are used in
seeking food in the soft mud of the shore.</p>
<p>The Knot visits the great lakes during
its migrations and is frequently observed
at that time. Its food, which consists of
the smaller crustaceans and shells, can be
as readily obtained on the shores of these
lakes as on those of the ocean, which it
also follows.</p>
<p>Dr. Ridgway tells us that &ldquo;Adult specimens
vary individually in the relative extent
of the black, gray and reddish colors
on the upper parts; gray usually predominates
in the spring, the black in midsummer.
Sometimes there is no rufous
whatever on the upper surface. The
cinnamon color of the lower parts also
varies in intensity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little is known of the nest and eggs of
the Knot owing to its retiring habits at
the nesting time and the fact that it breeds
in the region of the Arctic Circle, so little
frequented by man. One authentic report,
that of Lieutenant A. W. Greely,
describes a single egg that he succeeded
in obtaining near Fort Conger while
commanding an expedition to Lady
Franklin Sound. This egg was a little
more than an inch in length and about one
inch in diameter. Its color was a &ldquo;light
pea-green, closely spotted with brown in
small specks about the size of a pinhead.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A BIRD.</h2>
<p>My name is Dewey, and no bird was
ever prouder of his name. I know if Admiral
Dewey could see me he would feel
proud of his namesake, as I am said to be
an unusually handsome, intelligent bird.
I have been laughing in my wings for
many months, hearing people say what
kind of a bird I am. Some say I am an
oriole; some a male, others a female; another
a meadowlark; another not a meadowlark,
but some kind of lark. One
thing they agree upon, that I go on a
lark from early morn till &ldquo;Dewey eve.&rdquo;
I am said to have a little of the bluejay,
and points like dozens of birds. When
I was about six weeks old I was quite
large and fluffy, but very much of a baby,
for I knew nothing about feeding myself.
My tail was long, olive on top, yellow
underneath; wings black, with cream
color on the edges&mdash;on the lower feathers
just a line, on the upper ones quite a little
wider, at the top short yellow feathers,
making lovely little scallops; head and
back olive-brown; rump more on the yellow;
throat and breast light yellow, with
a tinge of blue under the wings, and belly
only tinted. As I grew older I kept
changing, and now at nine months old
my breast is light-orange, belly light-yellow,
head and back deeper olive, rump
deeper yellow. I broke my tail all off in
the fall, and when it came in, the upper
feathers were black, with yellow a quarter
of an inch at the rump; under ones
yellow and black. On my head are almost
invisible stripes of black, on my
neck pretty broken wavy ones. My eyes
are large and bright, my bill everyone
says is the handsomest they have ever
seen, very long and pointed as a needle.
Underneath ivory white, on top black,
with a white star at the head. The admiration
of all are my legs and claws, as
I keep them so clean, and they are a beautiful
blue, just the shade of malachite. I
am seven inches long, and for the last
month have been getting black spots over
my eyes and on my throat. Now what
kind of a bird am I?</p>
<p>One June afternoon I thought I was
old enough to take a walk by myself, so
off I started, without asking permission
of my father or mother. All went well
for awhile, and I was having a delightful
time, seeing many new strange things.
Then all at once I began to feel very tired
and hungry, and thought I would go
home, but which way to go I knew not.
I went this way and that and peeped as
loud as ever I could, calling &ldquo;Mother!
mother!&rdquo; but no answer came. Finally
I sat down, tucked my head under my
wing and went to sleep. The next thing
I knew something was coming down over
me and I was held very tight. I screamed,
pecked, and tried my best to get away.
Then someone said very gently: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, little birdie; I am not going to
harm you, but send you to a lady who
loves little birds, and will take good care
of you.&rdquo; I was dreadfully frightened, but
I did not make another peep. We went
a long way. Then I heard the little boy
say: &ldquo;Charlotte, will you please take this
bird to Miss Bascom, for she was so kind
to me when I was sick?&rdquo; I changed
hands, and off we went. Soon I heard
some one calling out: &ldquo;There comes
Charlotte with a bird.&rdquo; Then another
voice said: &ldquo;I wonder if it is another
sparrow;&rdquo; but when she saw me she exclaimed,
&ldquo;What a perfect beauty!&rdquo; took
me in her hand and I knew at once I
had found a good friend and new mother.
Bread and milk were ordered. Of course,
I did not know what bread and milk were,
but I was so hungry I could have swallowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
dirt or stones, so there was no
trouble about my taking it, and I wished
all birds could have such delicious food.
I was taken up-stairs to my new home,
where everything was in pink and green
and looked so fresh I thought I was back
in the clover field. My new mother (for
that is what I mean to call her) took me
up to what she called a cage and said:
&ldquo;Tricksey and Cervera, I want to introduce
you to your new brother.&rdquo; Tricksey
charmed me at once, for he was like
a ray of sunshine in his dress of gold, but
when I looked at Cervera I laughed right
out in his face. It was very rude, but I
know if any of you had been in my place
you would have done the same thing. Of
all the ugly specimens of a bird I had
ever seen he was the very worst. He was
Tricksey&rsquo;s size, but only had his baby
feathers and one tail feather. He was
dirt color, had big staring eyes, and
such a bill, almost as large as his head,
which was perfectly flat. He looked so
common and ill-bred that I wondered
how dainty Tricksey ever sat beside him.
I was too sleepy to ask any questions and
was soon fast asleep on my new mother&rsquo;s
finger; then was put into a nice little
basket filled with cotton. The next day
Tricksey was very kind to me, but Cervera
was cross and pecked me every time
he got a chance. Tricksey said: &ldquo;I have
tried to be kind to that old Spaniard, Cervera,
but I do not like him and will not
have him snuggle close to me nights, so
I fight him until he gets into the swing.
If you will sleep in the cage you may
put your wings close to mine, for you are
so pretty and clean.&rdquo; When bedtime
came my new mother said I was too large
for the basket, and I might try sleeping in
the cage, so she put me in and made Cervera
get up into the swing. Just as
Tricksey and I were going to sleep Cervera
began swinging with all his might,
and would reach down, peck us on the
head and pull our feathers out. When he
was caught he was taken out and made
to sleep in the basket. In the morning
we were all let out on the floor, and it
was amusing to see Cervera mimic everything
Tricksey did. If Tricksey took
a drink Cervera did, and would follow
everywhere he went.</p>
<p>About that time I saw coming into
the room a large, striped thing, with shining,
green eyes, and my heart beat so
fast I could hardly breathe. Tricksey
whispered in my ear: &ldquo;You need not be at
all afraid; that is only Taffy, the cat, and
we are the best of friends.&rdquo; Taffy
jumped into my new mother&rsquo;s lap, and
we three stood on the table and ate bread
and milk together. The first time I was
left in the room alone I looked around to
see what would be nice to play with. First
I went over to the dressing table, carried
two large cuff-buttons and put them into
my drinking cup, another pair I put on
the floor of the cage with two large coral
hairpins, two shell pins, and some studs.
I stuck all the pins on anything I
could pick up and threw them on the
floor; turned over a basket which was
filled with ribbon and lace; some I left on
the floor, and with the rest I trimmed the
cage. When I heard my new mother
coming I began to tremble. She stood
speechless for a moment, then said: &ldquo;You
rogue of a bird; how shall I punish you?&rdquo;
Then took me in her hand and kissed me,
and I knew the future was clear, and
I could have all the fun I wanted.
Tricksey had the asthma very bad, and
sometimes a little whisky on some sugar
would relieve him. It was funny to see
that bad Cervera maneuvre to get Tricksey
off the perch so he could eat the
sugar and whisky. Tricksey grew worse
instead of better, and one morning my
new mother was wakened early by his
hard breathing. She took him off from
his perch and found his claws ice-cold,
and he was so weak he could hardly hold
on. He lay in her hand a moment, then
threw back his pretty head and all was
over. We were all heart-broken and shed
many tears, for we were powerless to
bring back to life that little bird we loved
so dearly. I really felt sorry for that
horrid Cervera. He missed Tricksey, and
for days seemed to be looking for him.
One evening he went out the window,
and we never saw him again.</p>
<p>I am very fond of sweet apples and
generally whenever I want anything
that is down-stairs I go and get it. I love
grapes better than any other fruit. When
I want one I hop back and forth on the
back parlor table, then on top of a high
back chair and tease until one is given to
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
me. I like best to have my new
mother hold a grape in her right hand
while I perch on her left and suck all the
rich, sweet juice next the skin out first;
then I take the grape over on the table
on a paper and knock it until all the seeds
come out before I eat it. I like bananas,
too, and go to the fruit dish and open one
myself. Every morning I perch on the
plate or finger-bowl and eat my orange.</p>
<p>We usually have our orange in our
room, and sometimes I get so impatient
I fly over to the bed, back to the orange,
and beg my new mother to get up. I always
take a drink out of the finger bowl
and often said to myself, &ldquo;What a fine
bathtub this would make.&rdquo; When fall
came I began going to bed at 5 o&rsquo;clock,
and at 7 was awakened and taken out to
dessert. One night I became tired of waiting
and went out into the dining-room
very quietly, and the first thing I spied
was a finger-bowl, so thought that was
just the time for a bath. In I went. They
heard the splashing and looked up to see
everything as well as myself soaking wet.
Of course they thought it very cunning,
but after I did it for three nights I was
told two baths a day were too much for
me. I made up my mind if I could not
take a bath in the finger-bowl at night, I
would in the morning and, as I refused to
go near my old bathtub, the bowl was
given me for my own. There was a
bowl of Wandering Jew on the dining-table,
and several times I took a bath in
the center. All said I made a beautiful
picture, but when they found I was tearing
the vine all to pieces it was not so
pretty and many lectures were given to
me, but I heeded them not, and if taken
away I would walk (for I can walk as well
as hop) all over the table on the ends of
my toes and look every way but towards
the bowl; then, when no one was looking,
grab a piece and take it up on top of a
picture. One day I trimmed all of the pictures,
and there was none left in the
bowl, so I had to look up some other mischief.</p>
<p>When I go out to dinner I have my own
little table cloth and plate put by my new
mother&rsquo;s. I usually take a little of everything;
chicken and cranberry jelly is
very good. Sometimes I do not behave
very well, for I go tiptoeing across the
table to my grandmother&rsquo;s plate, hop on
the edge, and see if she has anything I
like. When dinner was ready to be
served I went over on the sideboard,
made holes in all the butter balls, then
took some mashed potato and boiled onion
and put them to cool in a big hole I
had made in an apple. Few people know
that birds are ever sick at their stomachs.
I had been in the habit of eating a little
shaved hickorynut that was put in a half
shell and kept in a dish on the back parlor
table. When I came down stairs I usually
took a taste, and it seemed to agree
with me. For a change I ate a little chestnut,
and soon began to feel bad, so
went off by myself and tried to go to
sleep. When my new mother saw me she
said she knew I was not well, for I never
acted that way in the daytime. She put
me in my cage, and sat down beside me.
I would close my eyes and open my bill,
and she thought I was dying until I opened
my bill very wide and out came the
chestnut in a lump a half inch long and a
quarter wide.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s writing desk is a favorite
place of mine. I get into drawers,
pigeon holes and ink; pictures and all
sorts of small things I throw on the floor.
Once I stole ever so many dimes and
pennies. I can lift a silver dollar and
often carry a coffee-spoon all about the
room, so you see I have a very strong bill.
If anything is lost all say &ldquo;Dewey must
have taken it.&rdquo; One day my new mother
looked until she was tired for her thimble.
When she asked me for it, I pretended
I did not hear, but as she was going
into the dining-room I dropped it down
on her head from the top of the portiere.
I often perch on a basket on top of the
book case in the writing room. When I
saw a new white veil beside me I went to
work and made ten of the prettiest eyelet
holes you can imagine, right in front;
some were round and some star-shaped.
As I grew older I said, &ldquo;I will not sleep
in my cage.&rdquo; For a few nights I insisted
upon sleeping on the brass rod at the
head of the bed, then changed to the top
of the curtain. I have a piece of soft flannel
over some cotton put on the ledge
and on the wall, so I will not take cold.
If it is very cold I get behind the frill of
the curtain, so no one can see me. If
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
warm I turn around so my tail hangs over
the outside. When my new mother comes
in I open my eyes, make a bow, and, if
not too sleepy, come down and sit on her
hand. I never chirp or peep, and when
I hide and hear &ldquo;Dewey, Dewey,&rdquo; I do
not answer but fly down on my new mother&rsquo;s
head, shoulder or hand. Taffy gets
so angry at me. I know he often feels
like killing me. I wake up early mornings,
and take my exercise by flying back
and forth from a picture on one side of
the room to the head of the bed. When
Taffy is on the foot of the bed I fly very
low, almost touching him with my wings,
and say, &ldquo;You lazy cat, why don&rsquo;t you
wake up and hear the little birds sing to
God Almighty; why don&rsquo;t you wake up?&rdquo;
I soon hear words that are not used in
polite society, and next see the end of his
tail disappearing around the corner of the
door. Before I go to sleep at night I exercise
again. One afternoon Taffy was
trying to take a nap in a chair in the back
parlor. I kept flying over him, making a
whizzing sound with my wings. When
he could endure it no longer he went into
the writing-room and sat down by his
mother. I went in to take a luncheon on
the table. Taffy stood up on his hind legs,
reached out a velvet paw, and gave me
such a slap I fell upon the floor. I was
not hurt in the least, flew up on a picture
and shook with laughter at the punishment
and scolding Mr. Taffy was getting.
He said very naughty words, scratched
and bit, but he was conquered at last, and
has behaved like a gentleman ever since.
The first time I saw the snow I was wild
with delight, flew to the window and tried
to catch the pretty white flakes. But
when I heard the sleigh bells they struck
terror to my heart, for I thought a whole
army of cats was coming, as all I knew
about bells are Taffy&rsquo;s. Not long ago
my new mother was very ill and had to
send for a strange physician, who knew
nothing about me. When I heard him
coming upstairs I hid behind the curtain
and watched him fix a white powder in a
paper. When he laid it on the table I
swooped down, grabbed it and took it
into my cage. After that I was kept busy,
as my grandmother was ill for many
weeks. I would carry off all the sleeping
powders; one day I put them behind the
bed, for I thought they would not taste
so badly, and do just as much good.</p>
<p>It did not take more than a minute to
get down there when I heard the doctor
come in, for I had to see that the medicine
was mixed all right. It was great fun
peering into the tiny little bottles in his
case. I would stand on the ends of my
toes and crane my neck to watch him
drop the medicine into the tumblers. The
other day some Christmas roses were
brought in. They looked so tempting I
took several bites, and the next day took
some more. I felt a little queer, and kept
opening my bill. My new mother thought
I had something in my throat and gave
me some water. The next afternoon she
found me on the floor panting, took me to
an open window, gave me wine and the
attack seemed to pass. We went up to
our room, and apparently I was as well
as ever when she went down to dinner.
After she had gone another attack came
on and I am too weak to write any more,
and can only warn little birds never to
taste of a Christmas rose, as they are said
to be deadly poison.</p>
<p class="tb">When I went to my room late in the
evening no little birdie peeped over the
curtain to greet me. I looked on the
floor, and there lay my darling Dewey,
stiff and cold.</p>

<p class="caption">AMERICAN HAWK OWL.
<br />(Surnia ulula caparoch.)

<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c12">THE AMERICAN HAWK OWL.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Surnia ulula caparoch.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The typical form of this owl (Surnia
ulula) is a native of Scandinavia and
Northern Russia, and incidentally is a
visitor to Western Alaska. We are told
by Mr. L. M. Turner, who was stationed
by the United States Signal Service in
Alaska from 1874 to 1881, that the natives
assert that this form is &ldquo;a resident,
and breeds in the vicinity of St. Michaels;
also that it is a coast bird, i. e., not going
far into the interior, and that it can live
a long time in winter without food, as it
remains for days in the protection of the
holes about the tangled roots of the willow
and alder patches.&rdquo; Its true breeding
range, however, is the northern portion
of the Eastern hemisphere. It is
somewhat larger and lighter in color than
the American Hawk Owl.</p>
<p>The bird of our illustration, the American
Hawk Owl, is simply a geographical
variety of the Old World form, and is a
native of northern North America, from
Alaska to Newfoundland. This is its
usual breeding range, though it migrates
in winter to the northern border of the
United States, and is an occasional visitor,
during severe winters, as far south
as Maine and Idaho. It is much more
common in the northern portion of its
range.</p>
<p>Unlike the other owls, as we usually
understand their habits, it may be considered
as strictly diurnal, seeking its prey,
to a great extent at least, during daylight,
usually during the early morning or evening
hours. Its principal food consists of
the various species of rodents, insects and
small birds. Its southward migration is
caused by that of its food species, especially
that of the lemmings.</p>
<p>It is a tame bird and may be said to
know no fear. We are told by Dr. A. K.
Fisher that &ldquo;specimens have been known
to return to the same perch after being
shot at two or three times. It is a courageous
bird, and will defend its nest
against all intruders. A male once dashed
at Dr. Dall and knocked off his hat as he
was climbing to the nest; other similar
accounts show that the courage displayed
on this occasion was not an individual
freak, but a common trait of the species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not alone in its diurnal habits is it like
the hawks, but it also resembles some of
them in selecting the dead branch of a
tall tree in some sightly locality from
which to watch for its prey. From this
position it will swoop down hawk-like.
Like the hawks its flight is swift and yet
noiseless, a characteristic which is common
to all the owls.</p>
<p>As a rule its note, which is a sharp,
shrill cry, is only sounded when flying.</p>
<p>As a nesting site, hollow trees are more
frequently chosen. However, nests built
of twigs and lined with grass are not infrequent.
These are usually placed on the
tops of stumps or among the branches of
dense cone-bearing trees. The number
of eggs varies from three to seven, and
are frequently laid long before the ice and
snow have disappeared. &ldquo;The eggs vary
from oval to oblong oval in shape, are
pure white in color, and somewhat glossy,
the shell is smooth and fine-grained.&rdquo; Incubation
begins as soon as the first egg is
laid, and both sexes participate in this
duty, and occasionally both are found on
the nest at the same time. At the nesting
season the courage of both sexes is
very marked. The male will fight with
its talons, and even when wounded will
still defend itself. We are told by Mr.
Gentry that &ldquo;calmly and silently it maintains
its ground, or springs from a short
distance on its foe. So, bravely it dies,
without thought of glory and without a
chance of fame; for of its kind there are
no cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird, like the other species of
owls, though possibly not to so great an
extent because of its diurnal habits, is
looked upon by the Indian tribes as a
bird of ill omen and by some tribes all
owls are called &ldquo;death birds.&rdquo; As a whole,
the hawk owls are perhaps more useful
to man than any other birds that are not
used as food. They cause but little trouble
in the poultry yard and are of incalculable
value to the farmer because of
the large number of small rodents that
they destroy.</p>

<h2 id="c15">THE OYSTER AND ITS RELATIVES.</h2>
<p>Of all the grand divisions of the Animal
Kingdom, the subkingdom Mollusca is
probably the least known to the ordinary
observer, and if one were asked to enumerate
as many different kinds of &ldquo;shell
fish&rdquo; as he could, it is probable that not
over six or eight different varieties would
be named. The majority of people think
of a clam, oyster, mussel, snail or Nautilus
and their molluscan vocabulary ends with
these names. And yet this group of animals
is second only to the insects in number
of different species, beauty of coloration
and interest of habitat. They may be
found everywhere, in salt and fresh water,
in our forests and fields, our ponds,
brooks and rivers; in the valleys and on
the mountain tops, and even in the waters
of the frozen north, while in the warm
waters of the tropics they flourish in uncounted
millions. In size they range from
the little sea-snails hidden in the eel grass
along the shore, with tiny shells scarcely
an eighth of an inch in length, to the
giant squid, which measures forty feet
or more from the tip of its tail to the end
of its long arms; and they range from the
tide-washed beach to the abyssal depths
of the ocean. It is to these lowly creatures
that I would draw the reader&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>In nearly all the species of the Mollusca
the animal is protected by a hard shell,
made of carbonate of lime, which is covered
with a horny epidermis to protect
the limy shell from being dissolved by
the acids in the water. This shell is generally
capable of containing the entire
animal, thus affording, in most cases, adequate
protection for the soft body.
Those animals not provided with a shell,
as is the case with the land slugs, are capable
of covering themselves with a sort
of mucus which encysts and protects
them from both extreme heat and cold.</p>
<p>The lowest branch of Mollusca is
known as class Pelecypoda, which comprises
all of the different kinds of clams,
mussels, quahaugs, etc., in which the
body is protected by two hard, calcareous
shells placed, generally, opposite each
other and connected on the upper margin
by a ligament, and the two valves
work back and forth in teeth and sockets,
making a kind of hinge. A set of stout
adductor muscles keep the two shells or
valves together and allow them to open
and close at the will of the animal. The
majority of clams live in the mud in a
horizontal position, the anterior end being
buried and the posterior end, containing
the siphons which draw in and expel
the water, being out of the mud, in the
water. The clam progresses by pushing
forward its strong, muscular foot, getting
a firm hold of the mud and then drawing
the shell after it. Some pelecypods, as
the oyster, live attached to some object
on the bottom of the water, as a stone,
piece of wood or piling of an old wharf,
and are not able to travel from place to
place as are the true clams, examples of
the latter being fresh water mussels and
the marine quahaug or round clam.</p>
<p>Some bivalves also attach themselves
by a byssus composed of a number of
silk-like threads, which anchor their
shells to stones, sticks, and other foreign
objects. In one group (genus Pinna)
found in the Mediterranean Sea, this
byssus is so fine and silky that the Italians
weave it with silk and make caps,
gloves and other articles of wearing apparel.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Another wonderful and interesting arrangement
for the comfort of the animal
is its breathing organs or branchiae.
These are two or four in number, and are
made up of numerous small chambers,
covered with little whip-like organs or
cilia, which keep up a constant motion,
creating currents of water, bring thousands
of minute organisms to the clam to
serve as food. These little organisms,
many of them microscopic, are caught
upon the surfaces of the gills, rolled into
little masses, and passed into the animal&rsquo;s
mouth. Besides being food-gatherers,
the gills serve to keep up a circulation by
which fresh water is constantly brought
in to purify and aerate the blood and also
to expel the waste products. There is no
head in this class, and the mouth is an
oval slit surrounded by four lips or palpi,
and leads almost directly into the stomach.</p>
<p>The currents of water spoken of above
are controlled and directed in several different
ways. In attached forms, and
those living above the surface of the mud,
like the oyster, mussel and scallop, the
soft mantle which lines the shell is divided,
forming a slit nearly the whole diameter
of the shell, and the water is allowed
to circulate freely through the open edges
of the shells. But in those animals which
burrow in the mud, as the common little
neck clam, fresh water clam and quahaug,
this mantle is closed and prolonged posteriorly
into one double or two single
siphons or tubes, one being fringed with
little finger-like cilia and drawing in the
water by their motion, and the other expelling
the water after it has circulated
through the animal.</p>
<p>One of the most attractive families of
bivalve shells is the Veneridae, or venus
shells, in which the shelly skeleton is ornamented
by many bright colors, the patterns
occurring in spots, dashes, zigzag
lines and rays. Some varieties, as the
spiny venus (Cytheria lupinaria) have the
posterior end of the shell provided with
long, sharp, curved spines, and the shell
is also frilled in a beautiful manner. The
common quahaug (round or hard-shelled
clam), which is esteemed an article of diet
on the Atlantic coast, and also to some
extent in the interior, is a prominent
member of this family. The Veneridae
comprise some five hundred species,
found throughout the world, and ranging
from the shore between tides to several
hundred fathoms in depth.</p>
<p>The family Cardiidae, the heart-shells
or cockles, comprise some of the largest
and most attractive of mollusks. The
name Cardium, signifying a heart, is
given them because of the close resemblance
to that organ when a shell is viewed
from the anterior end. These animals
live in sandy or muddy bays, and generally
congregate by thousands. In England,
the edible cockle (Cardium edule)
is considered quite a delicacy and thousands
are used for this purpose. In our
own country they are not generally eaten,
except by the poor in Florida and in some
places along the Gulf of Mexico, but the
waters of Florida furnish some very
handsome species, among them the Cardium
isocardia figured on our plate, and
the large Cardium magnum, which grows
to a length of five inches and whose shell
is ornamented by beautiful color-patterns
of brown and yellow. The foot of the
Cardium is very peculiar, being shaped
like a sickle, which enables the animal to
pull itself along at a lively gait. A California
cockle (Liocardium elatum) grows
to a diameter of seven inches and would
furnish a meal for several people.</p>
<p>In the family Tridacuidae size seems to
have reached its limit. Tridacena gigas,
found in the Indian Ocean, grows to a
length of nearly six feet and weighs upwards
of eight hundred pounds. Tryon
records that a pair of these shells, weighing
five hundred pounds, and two feet in
diameter, are used as benetiers in the
church of St. Sulpice, Paris. In some
parts of the Indian Ocean, where pearl
and sponge-fishing are carried on, this
clam (known as the giant clam), is a
source of great danger to the divers,
many losing their lives by being caught
between the great valves of the shell, by
either hands or feet. Many times a diver
has amputated his fingers, hand or foot,
and thus saved his life at the expense of
one or more of these members.</p>
<p>The Tellinas (family Tellinidae) number
among its five hundred or more species
some very beautiful and interesting
animals. They live for the most part
buried in sand or sandy mud and are
found throughout the entire world. Our
common Tellina radiata, familiarly
called sunshell, is found in Florida
and the West Indies, and
a typical valve looks not unlike the
horizon at sunrise, the brilliant rays of
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
color spreading in different directions
from a common center. At Newport,
Rhode Island, the writer has gathered
many thousand specimens of a beautiful
little Tellen (Tellina tenera), whose shell
measures scarcely half an inch in diameter
and is tinted a lovely pink or pinkish
white. The siphons of this family are
very long and are separated, the upper
one being half or three-quarters as long
as the lower one, and the foot is rather
long and pointed, admirably adapted for
burrowing. The long siphons enable the
animal to bury itself to quite a depth beneath
the surface of the sand.</p>
<p>Closely related to the Tellinidae is the
Psammobiidae, a characteristic form of
which (Psammobia rubroradiata) is thus
spoken of by Prof. Josiah Keep, in his interesting
little book, &ldquo;West Coast Shells:&rdquo;
&ldquo;But I wanted to see more of him, so I
took a large jar, filled it half full of beach
sand, added as much sea-water as it
would hold, and plunged my prize into
the same. He rested quietly for a few
minutes, and then began to open his shell
and cautiously put out his two siphons.
Soon afterward, from between the edges
of his shells, came his big, white, spade-shaped
foot. He drove it down into the
sand, curved it a little to one side, gave
a vigorous pull, and lo! his shell followed,
though just why I could not clearly understand.
Though the jar was large he
reached the bottom before his shell was
wholly covered with sand, and had to
content himself with a half-above-ground
tenement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning his siphons were
stretched out some six inches in length.
* * * I never thought before that
there was any particular beauty to the
siphons of a clam, but for this red-lined
one my opinions quickly changed. Imagine
two tubes made of the finest pink
and white silk, stretched over delicate
hoops arranged at regular intervals; then
think of them as endowed with life, and
waving with a graceful motion through
the water, and you will have a faint idea
of their exquisite texture and elegant appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To those readers who live in the West,
away from the ocean, the Unio, or freshwater
mussel, is more or less familiar.
What child in Chicago has not played on
the sands of Lake Michigan and scooped
up the little grains with the broken half
of a clam shell? Or who, wading in the
muddy water of Lake Calumet, has not
wondered what the curious little hollow,
fringed objects were which protruded
from the surface of the mud? These latter
were the siphons of the clam and if
you were to dig under them a little way
you would find the beautiful green-rayed
shell of a river mussel. These are no less
interesting than the marine shells already
described and in beauty of ornamentation
they frequently excel many of their salt-water
relatives. Such excrescences as
knobs, spines and rib-like undulations are
common, while the colors of the interior
range from pure silvery white through
orange, pink and salmon to dark purple,
and the rich, pearly iridescence rivals that
of any of the marine shells. In many
parts of the West mussels are collected by
men in search of pearls, which are generally
of an inferior quality, and thousands
of shells are used annually in the
manufacture of pearl buttons.</p>
<p>One of the most familiar objects to the
seaside visitor is the huge banks of sea-mussels
(Mytilus) which line the shore
at low water. The shells are generally
dark-colored, our common mussel (Mytilus
edulis) being frequently jet black, and
are more or less wedge-shaped in form.
They attach themselves to mud banks and
shore vegetation by a strong byssus made
up of stout, more or less silky threads.
The mussels are of great value economically,
thousands of bushels of the edible
mussel (Mytilus edulis) being consumed
annually in Europe. They are also used
as bait, and millions of the mussels are
thus used every year. Although considered
a delicacy in parts of Great Britain
and Europe, it has not yet been adopted
as an article of diet in this country, the
clam and quahaug taking its place.</p>
<p>The family Aviculidae, comprising the
wing-shells or pearl oysters, is of great
interest, both scientifically and economically.
At the present time there are a little
over one hundred species living, but
the family has been known from early
geological times and over a thousand
species have been found in the rocks.
The pearl-oyster (Melleagrina margaritifera)
is the most important member of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
this family, furnishing as it does the beautiful
pearls of commerce. These animals
are found at Madagascar, Ceylon and
other parts of the Indian Ocean, several
hundred tons being imported into Europe
annually. These pearls are formed by
some irritating substance, as a grain of
sand or some parasite, getting in between
the shell and the animal, or lodging in
some soft part, which causes the animal
to cover it with pearly matter to prevent
irritation. The shells also furnish a considerable
part of the &ldquo;mother-o&rsquo;-pearl&rdquo;
which is so largely used for ornamental
purposes. The Margaritifera radiata, figured
on our plate, is a member of this
family.</p>
<p>The scallop is an object well known to
the tourist visiting New England summer
resorts, who has reveled in &ldquo;fried
scallops.&rdquo; The family to which this belongs
(Pectinidae) is composed of rounded
shells, many with frills or ribs and
nearly all ornamented with beautiful colors.
Unlike the animals which we have
been considering, these mollusks have no
siphons and the shell is open all the way
around save at the hinge, and the edge
of the mantle is provided with little,
round, black eyes. It is an interesting
sight to observe a beach at low water, the
receding tide having left on the shore or
in little pools of water hundreds of these
mollusks, attached by a byssus to bits of
sea weed. As one is gazing wonderingly
over this vast field of yellow sand and
green weed, an object will suddenly move
through a pool of water with astonishing
rapidity, accompanying the movement by
a quick snapping sound. This is the
scallop, which is imprisoned in the pool
and which desires to get out. The movement
is effected by rapidly closing and
opening the two valves of the shell, thereby
causing a clicking sound. The noise
of several hundred of these shells opening
and closing and the sight of as many
scallops with strings of sea weed attached
to them, shooting through the water,
looking not unlike a comet with a long
tail, is quite bewildering. In Europe, the
scallop is considered quite a delicacy and
several tons are gathered annually. One
species (Pecten jacobaeus) has been dignified
as a badge of several orders of
knighthood and it was also worn by pilgrims
to the Holy Land a good many
years ago. It was called &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;
Shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most common shell to the layman
is the oyster (Ostrea virginica), the cultivation
of which occupies the attention of
a large number of men and the investment
of considerable capital. The oyster
is free and active when young, but becomes
attached to some submerged object
early in life. Oyster culturists take
advantage of this habit by erecting poles
in the water to which the young oysters
attach themselves. The shells of the different
species of oyster are not generally
of much beauty, but a related family, the
Spondylidae, or spiny oysters, are among
the most beautiful of bivalves. In this
family the shell is ornamented by many
long spines and frills, and the colors are
different shades of red, yellow and pink.
The most beautiful species are found in
the Gulf of California.</p>
<p>The space at our command is far too
limited to adequately discuss the many
curious and interesting animals which
make up the class Pelecypoda. Much
might be said of the Solen or razor-shell,
with its curious foot which is so great a
help in digging burrows; of the Pholads,
which perforate and make burrows in
clay, wood and even in the hardest rock;
and of the strange Teredo or &ldquo;shipworm,&rdquo;
with a long, worm-like body
which bores into ships, wharves and any
wooden object within reach. But enough
has been written and pictured to show the
reader that the unpretentious clam, mussel
or oyster and their relatives have
many interesting habits, are encased in
beautiful shells, and that some species are
of great economic importance to man.</p>

<h2 id="c18">THE COLLARED LIZARD.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Crotaphytus collaris.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Collared or Ring-necked Lizard
may be found among the rocks and open
woods of the plateau or in desert regions
from southern Missouri southward into
Mexico, westward to southeastern California
and northward to southern Idaho.
However, this is its general range, and it
is not common over all this territory.
Though it has been known to ascend to
an altitude of nearly six thousand feet,
yet it does not seem to have crossed the
Sierra Nevada range, as it has not been
observed at any point on the Pacific coast
or the interior of California.</p>
<p>The Collared Lizard is so called because
of the black bars, which resemble a
collar, and are situated between the fore
legs and extend across the back of the
animal. They vary greatly in color, depending
on their age or geographical position.
The back is usually some shade
of dull or rather dark green, or it may
have a bluish cast, with numerous oblong
or rounded lighter spots, which may be
either whitish, or various shades of red,
orange or yellow. These spots may be
quite definite or they may form quite continuous
bands. The variations in color
are much more marked in the young.</p>
<p>Dr. Cope tells us that &ldquo;it runs very
swiftly, carrying the tail over its back. In
its manners it is perhaps the most pugnacious
of our lizards, opening its mouth
when cornered, and biting savagely. Its
sharp teeth can do no more than slightly
cut the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Frank M. Woodruff relates the
following interesting account of his experiences
with this lizard: &ldquo;I found the
Collared Lizard at three points in Missouri&mdash;Vineland,
DeSoto and Pilot Knob.
They are restricted to the rocky glades,
where they live with the scorpions and
the rattlesnakes. The only place where I
found them abundant was between Vineland
and the old Kingston mines. During
the hot summer months they make
their appearance upon the broad slabs of
rock, often quite a distance from their
lairs. When disturbed they make a dash
to escape and usually in the direction that
leads to their accustomed crevice, even
though the intruder is in its path. I
have had them run almost across my feet
in their frantic efforts to hide. They are
a somewhat terrifying object as they run
toward you. At this time they apparently
assume a partly upright position,
looking for all the world like a small edition
of Mephistopheles. The negroes are
mortally afraid of them. They call them
&lsquo;Glade Devils,&rsquo; and the more superstitious
believe that the souls of the very
bad negroes reside in them. A negro will
never go through a glade frequented by
this species, and will make a long detour
to avoid doing so. The only time I ever
saw a negro &lsquo;turn gray&rsquo; was when I
brought one of these lizards to Ironton
and asked for assistance in capturing it
when it escaped. They are so swift in
their movements that I found the best
method of capturing them was by tying a
noose of fine copper wire to a fish pole.
This can be slipped over their heads, as
they lie sunning themselves, as they seem
to pay but little attention to the loop as it
touches them. By exercising caution it
is possible to approach from the rear to
within eight or ten feet without exciting
them. They make delightful pets, if a
lizard can be considered such. By feeding
them through the winter on meal
worms and in the summer on flies and
grasshoppers they can be kept for a year
or more.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19">A NIGHT IN THE FLOWER GARDEN.
<br /><span class="small">A FAIRY STORY.</span></h2>
<p>The day had passed and the sun had
gone to sleep in a bed of crimson and
gold. The wind blew softly, at which the
leaves on the great trees in the garden began
to murmur; though it was evening
they were not sleepy like some of the
flowers who thought it time to go to
sleep when the sun did. Sometimes the
leaves were awake all night; you could
hear them moving gently in the breeze.
The clover leaves were folded close in
sleep long ago and the Poppies declared
they could not sit up a moment longer.
But the tall white Lilies, who loved the
night, were wide awake; they could not
sleep when the garden was full of moonlight.
They said the Crickets were so
noisy and the Katydids so quarrelsome
that it disturbed them, so they stood fair
and white gathering the dew in their silvery
cups which filled the soft night air
with sweet perfume. The Roses were
looking pale and sad in the moonlight;
they reveled in the golden sunshine and
grew brilliant in the heat of day. But
they were languid now and sometimes a
little breeze would send their velvet petals
floating to the ground to fade and die.</p>
<p>The Pansies nestled low with closed
eyes. You would not have known where
the Mignonette and Heliotrope were had
you not breathed their sweet perfume,
for they were fast asleep. The Nasturtiums,
Hollyhocks, and Marigolds were
still as bright and gay as if the sun, whom
they loved, could see them and they felt
like sitting up with the Four O&rsquo;Clocks
and Evening Primroses, who never went
to sleep until very late.</p>
<p>But of all the flowers in the garden, the
Sweet Peas were the widest awake. There
they stood in rows, dainty and fair, never
thinking of going to sleep, but trembling
with excitement. You could see them
whispering together, for they had heard
that to-night the Fairy Queen was to
come to the garden and would give a soul
to some flower; which one they did not
know but hoped it would be to them.</p>
<p>A little Humming Bird had brought
the news and had told it only to the
Sweet Peas, so they thought it must be
for them that this beautiful change was to
come. Had they not heard that years ago
a sweet flower called Narcissus had been
changed into a beautiful youth, who could
wander where he wished? What delight
that would be! And had they not also
heard of Pansies changing into little children,
and Larkspurs into larks that
soared away into the bright blue sky? Of
Water Lilies changing into maidens, who
made their homes under the green waves?
And they had always thought that
myriads of brilliant flowers were changed
into the daintiest of all things. The little
Humming Birds must have been flowers
at one time, for they were always hovering
around them, kissing them and making
love to them. Oh! if the Fairy Queen
would only change them into birds, or
velvet bees, or, better still, into the beautiful
butterflies, that came to them so
often and fluttered like a cloud around
them. Yes, they would rather be butterflies
than anything else.</p>
<p>Slowly the moonlight faded from the
flowers, the shadows of the night deepened
and the soft dew fell like a benediction.
A Fairy form floated over the
sweetest of blossoms, then disappeared,
and all was dark and silent save a gentle
flutter, as of wings.</p>
<p>But in the morning when the sunbeams
had awakened the sleeping blossoms, a
flight of bright-winged Butterflies floated
in the air or lighted for a moment on the
flowers, but the Sweet Peas had all disappeared
and were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h2 id="c21">THE APPLE.</h2>
<p>Both pagan and Christian mythologies
have endowed the Apple with wonderful
virtues. It has possessed a symbolism
for man in all stages of civilization.
Standing for the type of the earthly in its
contrast with the spiritual, it represented
the idea of that conflict between Ormuzd
and Arimanes in which the evil
principle is continually victor. The
stories of Eve, of Paris, the Hesperides
and Atalanta all emphasize this thought,
showing the Apple to have been a reward
of appetite over conscience.</p>
<p>The allegorical tree of knowledge bore
apples guarded by the serpent, and the
golden fruit of the garden of Hesperides
was apples protected by the sleepless
dragon, which it was one of the triumphs
of Hercules to slay. The Assyrian tree
Gavkerena, the Persian &ldquo;Jima&rsquo;s Paradise,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Indra&rsquo;s heaven&rdquo; and the Scandinavian
ash tree Yggdrasil, all prefaced the
story of Paris and the apple of discord
which Ate brought to the banquet of the
gods. In Greece it became the emblem
of love, being dedicated to Venus. Aphrodite
bore it in her hand as well as Eve,
and it is said that Ulysses longed for it in
the garden of Alcinous, while Tantalus
vainly grasped for it in hades. The fruit
was offered as a prize in the Grecian
games given in honor of Apollo.</p>
<p>Among the heathen gods of the north
there were apples fabled to possess the
power of conferring immortality, which
were carefully watched over by the goddess
Iduna and jealously preserved for
the dessert of the gods who experienced
the enervation of old age. Azrael accomplished
his mission by holding the
apple to the nostrils of his victims, and
the Scandinavian genii are said to have
possessed the power of turning the fruit
into gold.</p>
<p>The ancients better appreciated the importance
of the apple than do the moderns,
who treat it chiefly as &ldquo;the embryonic
condition of cider or as something
to be metamorphosed into pies.&rdquo; It is
said to be indigenous to every part of the
inhabited globe except South America
and the islands of the Pacific. It is
equally at home in the fierce heat of the
equator and among the frosts of Siberia.
In olden times, the fig was the index of a
native civilization. Later on, the vine
was king, but at the present time there
are many who maintain that the Apple is
the only genuine index of civilized man,
and claim that it flourishes best in those
regions where man&rsquo;s moral and intellectual
supremacy is most marked.</p>
<p>The Athenians made frequent mention
of the cultivation of the Apple, and Pliny
enumerates twenty varieties that were
known in his day. It is generally supposed
that the Goths and Vandals introduced
the manufacture and use of cider
into the Mediterranean provinces and
references to it are made by Tertullian
and the African Fathers. The use of cider
can be traced from Africa into the
Biscayan provinces of Spain, and thence
to Normandy. It is supposed to have
come into England at the time of the conquest,
but the word &ldquo;cyder&rdquo; is said to be
Anglo-Saxon, and there is reason to believe
that it was known in the island as
early as the time of Henghist. As the
mistletoe grew chiefly on the apple and
the oak, the former was regarded with
great respect by the ancient Druids of
Britain, and even to this day in some
parts of England, the antique custom of
saluting the apple trees in the orchards,
in the hope of obtaining a good crop the
next year, still lingers among the farmers
of Devonshire and Herefordshire. During
the middle ages, the fruit was made
the pretext for massacring the oppressed
tribes of Israel, as it was supposed
that the Hebrews used apples to
entice children into their homes to furnish
their cannibal banquets.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The different varieties of apples have
all descended from a species of crab found
wild in most parts of Europe. Although
there are two or three species of wild
crab belonging to this country, yet none
of our cultivated varieties have been raised
from them, but rather from seeds of the
species brought here by the colonists
from Europe&mdash;over two hundred varieties
of apples are known at the present
time. As a rule, the Apple is a hardy,
slow-growing tree, with an irregular
head, rigid branches, roughish bark, and
a close-grained wood. It thrives best in
limestone soils and deep loams. It will
not flourish in wet soils or on those of
a peaty or sandy character. As a rule,
the trees live to be fifty or eighty years of
age, but there are specimens now bearing
fruit in this country that are known to be
over two hundred years old. The wood
is often stained black and used as ebony.
It is also made into shoe lasts, cog-wheels
and small articles of furniture, and is
greatly prized in Italy for wood carving
and statuary.</p>
<p>New and choice varieties of apples are
derived from seeds planted to produce
stocks. One stock in ten thousand may
prove better than the original, and its
virtues are perpetuated by layers, cuttings,
graftings and budding. The tree
is not subject to disease. Insects, notably
the borer, the woolly aphis, the caterpillar,
the apple moth and the bark louse,
have to be guarded against, and several
blights occasionally attack the foliage,
but as a rule small loss is experienced
from these sources.</p>

<h2 id="c23">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF SEED-BEARING PLANTS.</h2>
<p>This is one of the most difficult and important
subjects connected with the study
of plants. Before it can be well organized
it will be necessary to bring together very
many more observations of plants in all
parts of the world than is possible now.
However, a few facts are known which
are both interesting and suggestive. In
order to make their presentation as definite
as possible, this paper will be restricted
to a brief account of the geographic
distribution of seed plants.</p>
<p>One of the two great groups of seed
plants is known as the Gymnosperms, a
group which in our region is represented
by pines, spruces, hemlocks, cedars, etc.
In the tropics the group is represented
by a very different type of trees, known
as the Cycads. They resemble in general
habit tree-ferns, or palms. The group
of Gymnosperms with which we are acquainted
have been called Conifers on
account of the very characteristic cones
which they bear. Several principles connected
with geographic distribution may
be illustrated by considering briefly these
two groups of Gymnosperms.</p>
<p>The Cycads are absolutely restricted to
the tropics, a few forms reaching into
semi-tropical conditions, as in southern
Florida. If a comparison be made between
the eastern and western tropics, it
will be discovered that the Cycads are
almost equally divided between the two
regions. For an unknown time, but certainly
a very long one, these eastern and
western Cycads have been separated from
one another. As a consequence they have
become so unlike that one kind of Cycad
is never found in both hemispheres.
Their long separation from one another,
and their somewhat different conditions
of living, have resulted in working out
differences of structures which botanists
recognize as species, genera, etc.</p>
<p>The Conifers, on the other hand, are
characteristic of temperate regions. If
the distribution of Conifers were indicated
upon a world map, there would be shown
a heavy massing of them in the northern
region and a lighter massing in the southern
region, the two being separated from
one another by a broad tropical belt. This
tropical belt is traversed in just two
places; one is by means of the East Indian
bridge, across which certain Australasian
forms reach China and Japan;
the other is the chain of the Andes mountains,
along which a single northern type
has worked its way into the southern part
of South America. The two great masses
of Conifers, therefore, lie in the northern
and southern hemispheres, rather than
in the eastern and western hemispheres,
as is the case with the Cycads. This long
separation has resulted just as it did with
the Cycads; that is, the northern and
southern Conifers are not any longer
alike, but differ so widely from one another
that botanists cannot discover any
form which is common to both the northern
and southern hemispheres, excepting
the single one already mentioned, which
has succeeded in crossing the tropics by
means of the Andes bridge.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact in connection
with the distribution of the Conifers is
that their great centers of display are in
regions which border the Pacific Ocean,
and they have often been spoken of as a
Pacific group. There are three special
centers of display; one is the China-Japan
region, a second is the general Australasian
region, and the third is western
North America. Just why this border region
of the Pacific is especially favorable
for this sort of plant life is a question
which we do not as yet pretend to answer.
Another fact which illustrates this persistent
distribution in connection with
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the Pacific is that in the case of the Conifers
which belong to the southern hemisphere,
the continental masses which
pair in the display of similar forms are
Australia and South America.</p>
<p>Another fact, which is true of all large
groups, is that certain forms have a very
extensive distribution, and others are
very much restricted in their occurrence.
For example, the greatest genus of Conifers
is the genus made up by the pines, at
least seventy kinds of which are recognized.
This great genus sweeps throughout
all the north temperate regions of the
globe. There is a similar extensive distribution
of the different kinds of spruce,
larch, juniper, etc. On the other hand,
the giant redwood, known as Sequoia, is
restricted to certain comparatively small
areas in California. In China and Japan,
and also in Australia, there are numerous
illustrations of forms very much restricted
in their occurrence.</p>
<p>The other great group of seed plants is
known as the Angiosperms, and to it belong
all those seed plants which are most
commonly met in this region. The distribution
of Angiosperms is a very much
more difficult question than that of Gymnosperms;
for while there are only about
four hundred kinds of living Gymnosperms,
there are more than one hundred
thousand kinds of living Angiosperms.
In presenting the distribution of this
great group, it will be necessary to consider
its two main divisions separately,
for they differ from one another very
much. One of the groups is known as
the Monocotyledons, to which belong
such forms as the grasses, lilies, palms,
orchids, etc.</p>
<p>Some prominent facts in reference to
the geographical distribution of these
Monocotyledons are as follows: They
contain four great families, which include
almost one-half of their number, and which
have become world-wide in their distribution.
These families are the grasses, the
sedges, the lilies, and the irises. This
world-wide distribution means that these
families have succeeded in adapting themselves
to every condition of soil and climate.
In this world-distribution the
grasses easily lead, not only among Monocotyledons,
but among all seed plants.</p>
<p>Another fact in reference to the Monocotyledons
is that they include an unusual
number of families which are entirely
aquatic in their habit. These aquatic families
are also world-wide in their distribution,
so far as fresh and brackish waters
can be called world-wide. It is important to
notice that while the world-families which
belong to the land have worked out about
ten thousand different forms, the world-families
which belong to the water have
worked out considerably less than two
hundred different forms. This seems to
indicate that the great number in the one
case is due to the very diverse conditions
of the land, while the small number in the
latter case is due to the very uniform conditions
of water life.</p>
<p>A third fact of importance is that the
Monocotyledons are mainly massed in
the tropics, and in this sense are almost
an exact contrast to the Conifers we have
been considering above. The same effect
of separation in working out diversity in
structure is shown by the Monocotyledons
as was shown by the eastern and
western Cycads, and the northern and
southern Conifers. For example, the
palms represent the great tree group of
Monocotyledons, and are restricted to
the tropics as rigidly as are the Cycads.
They are found in about equal numbers
in the eastern and western tropics, but
there are no forms in common. The eastern
and western forms have become so
different that they might almost be regarded
as different families.</p>
<p>The Monocotyledons are also somewhat
famous for the number of air plants
which they contain&mdash;that is, plants which
have sometimes been called &ldquo;perchers,&rdquo;
because they fasten themselves upon
trunks and branches and supports of
various kinds, and absorb what they need
directly from the air. It is a notable fact
that these so-called &ldquo;perchers&rdquo; are very
much more abundant in the western tropics
than in the eastern. An explanation
for this is to be found in the fact that the
western tropics have a very much greater
rainfall; in fact, in the rainy woods of the
Amazon region the air is saturated with
water, and everything is dripping.</p>
<p>One of the facts in connection with the
distribution of Monocotyledons is quite
puzzling, and that is the very poor representation
of the whole group in the southern
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
hemisphere. In examining the distribution
of other groups in the southern
hemisphere, it is found that Australia and
its general vicinity is prolific in peculiar
forms. In the case of the Monocotyledons,
however, the Australasian region is
the most poverty-stricken one in all the
southern hemisphere. Just why the
southern hemisphere in general, and the
Australasian region in particular, are unfavorable
for Monocotyledons, it is hard
to say. Of course in these cases the world-families
already mentioned are represented.</p>
<p>The other great division of Angiosperms
is known as Dicotyledons, which
include such forms as our common forest
trees, buttercups, roses, peas, mints,
sunflowers, etc. As there are about eighty
thousand of these Dicotyledons, it is impossible
to state anything very definite in
reference to the distribution of the group
as a whole. Taking the higher forms,
however, as representing the general tendency
of the group, some of the facts of
distribution are as follows:</p>
<p>It has been noticed that the Monocotyledons
are massed in the tropics, and that
the temperate and boreal regions have
been left comparatively free by previous
groups, with the exception of the Conifers,
which only develop tree types. With
the coming of the Dicotyledons, therefore,
the vast temperate and boreal regions
presented a particularly favorable
field, which they have entered and taken
possession of. This vast group is prominently
adapted to living in the unoccupied
temperate and boreal regions. This
does not mean that they are not found in
the tropics for they hold their own there
with the other groups.</p>
<p>Dicotyledons, however, succeeded in
working out but three world-families:
Composites, to which the sunflowers,
dandelions, etc., belong; the Mints; and
the Plantains. There are other large
families which characterize certain great
areas, but they are not world-wide in
their distribution.</p>
<p>Another fact, which might indicate that
the Dicotyledons have taken possession of
comparatively unoccupied regions only,
is that they are very poorly represented,
so far as higher groups are concerned, in
aquatic conditions. It would seem as
though the conditions of life in the water
had been fairly well taken up by other
groups. In looking over the display of
Dicotyledons in the tropics of the eastern
and western hemispheres, it becomes evident
that there is no such difference between
the forms of the two regions as in
the groups previously mentioned. It will
be remembered, however, that in the case
of the Cycads and palms, which were used
as illustrations, they are restricted to
the tropics, and their eastern and western
forms are separated from one another,
not merely by oceans, but by temperate
and boreal lands. In the case of Dicotyledons
this is different, for while they
are found in the tropics, they are found in
the other regions as well, and have better
chances for intermingling than the other
groups.</p>
<p>This tropical display of Dicotyledons
further shows the great prominence of
America in the display of forms. This
appears not merely in the greater number
of peculiar forms and often families
which appear in tropical America; but
whenever the continents are paired in the
display of forms, America is always one
of the pair, Asia or Africa being the other
member.</p>
<p>It will be recognized from what has
been said that the whole subject of geographic
distribution is a very extensive
one, and that it will be a long time before
the important facts are recorded. The
importance of the subject rests not so
much upon the mere presence of certain
plants in certain regions, but it has to do
with explaining just why the conditions
are suited to the plants, and also just how
the plants have come to be what they are
and where they are.</p>

<p>Vanilla planifolia belongs to the Orchid
family (Orchidaceae), though it has
many characteristics not common to most
members of the family. It is a fleshy,
dark-green perennial climber, adhering
to trees by its aerial roots, which are produced
at the nodes. The stem attains a
length of many feet, reaching to the very
tops of the supporting trees. The young
plant roots in the ground, but as the stem
grows in length, winding about its support
and clinging to it by the aerial roots,
it loses the subterranean roots and the
plant establishes itself as a saprophyte or
partial parasite, life habits common to
orchids. The leaves are entire, dark-green,
and sessile. Inflorescence consists
of eight to ten flowers sessile upon axillary
spikes. The flowers are a pale greenish
yellow, perianth rather fleshy and
soon falls away from the ovary or young
fruit, which is a pod, and by the casual
observer would be taken for the flower
stalk. The mature fruit is a brown curved
pod six to eight inches long, smooth,
splitting lengthwise in two unequal parts,
thus liberating the numerous, very small,
oval or lenticular seeds.</p>
<p>There are several species of vanilla indigenous
to Eastern Mexico, growing in
warm, moist, shaded forests. It is now
extensively cultivated in Mexico; also in
Mauritius, Bourbon, Madagascar and
Java. It is extensively grown in hot-houses
of England and other temperate
countries. The wild growing plants no
doubt depended upon certain insects for
pollination, but with the cultivated plants
this is effected artificially by means of a
small brush.</p>
<p>The word vanilla is derived from the
Spanish vainilla, the diminutive of vaina,
meaning a sheath or pod, in reference to
the fruit. There is little doubt that the
natives of Mexico employed vanilla as a
flavor for cocoa long before the discovery
of America. We received our first
description of the plant from the Spanish
physician Hernandez, who, during
1571-1577 explored New Spain or Mexico.
In 1602, Morgan, apothecary to
Queen Elizabeth, sent specimens of the
fruit to Clusius, who described it independently
of Hernandez. In 1694 vanilla
was imported to Europe by way of Spain.
In France it was much used for flavoring
chocolate and tobacco. During the first
half of the eighteenth century it was extensively
used in Europe, particularly in
England, after which it seems to have
gradually disappeared. Now it is, however,
again very abundantly employed in
nearly all countries.</p>
<p>Vanilla must be cultivated with great
care. In Mexico a clearing is made in
the forest, leaving a few trees twelve to
fifteen feet apart to serve as a support for
the vanilla plants. Cuttings of the vanilla
stems are made three to five feet in
length, one cutting being inserted into the
soil to a depth of about ten inches near
each tree. The cuttings become rooted
in about one month and grow quite rapidly,
but do not begin to bear fruit until
the third year and continue to bear for
about thirty years. In Reunion, Mauritius
and the Seychelles the young plants
are supported by a rude trellis fastened
between the trunks of trees. In cultivation
pollination is universally effected artificially;
the pollen being transplanted
from one flower to another by means of
a small brush or pencil. Only the finest
flowers are thus fertilized so as to prevent
exhaustion and to insure a good
commercial article. Among wild growing
plants pollination is effected through
the agency of insects, which evidently do
not occur in the vicinity of the plantations;
thus man is called upon to assist
nature. The pods are cut off separately
as they ripen; if over-ripe they are apt
to split in drying; if collected green the
product will be of an inferior quality.</p>
<p>The peculiar fragrance of the vanilla
pods is due to vanillin, which occurs upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
the exterior of the dried fruit in the form
of a crystalline deposit, which serves as
a criterion of quality. This substance
does not pre-exist in the ripe fruit. It is
developed in the process of drying and
fermentation. In Mexico the collected
pods are placed in heaps under a shed until
they begin to wilt or shrivel, whereupon
they are subjected to the sweating
process conducted as follows: The pods
are wrapped in woolen cloth and exposed
to the sun during the day or heated
in an oven at 140&deg;F., then enclosed in
air-tight boxes at night to sweat. In
twenty-four to thirty-six hours they assume
a chestnut-brown color. They are
then dried in the sun for several months.</p>
<p>In Reunion the pods are first scalded
for a few minutes in boiling hot water,
then exposed to the sun for about one
week, wrapped in woolen blankets; then
spread out and dried under sheds, turning
frequently so as to insure uniform drying.
When the pods can be twisted around
the finger without splitting or cracking
the &ldquo;smoothing process&rdquo; begins. This
consists in rolling the pods between the
fingers to distribute the unctuous liquid,
which exudes during the sweating process
(fermentation), and to which the pods
owe their lustre and suppleness.</p>
<p>Vanilla workers are apt to suffer from
an affection known as vanillism, characterized
by an itching eruption of the skin,
nasal catarrh, more or less headache and
muscular pain. By some this is said to
be caused by a poisonous substance in the
vanilla or perhaps the oil of cashew, with
which the pods are coated. According
to others the trouble, at least the itching
and eruption, is caused by a species of
acarus (itch mite) found upon the pod.
It must also be borne in mind that most
of these workers are anything but cleanly
in their habits. Bacteria, dirt, etc., find
their way to the pods from the dirty hands
of the workmen. The entire process of
gathering, sweating, drying, smoothing
and packing, as carried on in Mexico and
South American countries is not conducted
in accordance with recognized
sanitary rules.</p>
<p>There are a number of commercial varieties
of vanilla named after the countries
in which they are grown or after the
centers of export, as Mexican, Vera Cruz,
Bourbon, Mauritius, Java, La Guayra,
Honduras and Brazilian vanilla. The
most highly valued Mexican variety is
known as Vainilla de leg (leg, meaning
law). The pods are long, dark-brown,
very fragrant and coated with crystals.
Since vanilla is a costly article adulteration
is quite common. Useless pods are
coated with balsam of Peru to give them
a good appearance. Split, empty pods
are filled with some worthless material,
glued together and coated with balsam
of Peru.</p>
<p>Vanillin also occurs in Siam benzoin,
in raw beet-sugar and in cloves. It has
been artificially prepared from coniferin,
a substance found in the sap-wood of fir-trees,
and from asafoetida. In Germany
commercial vanilla is now largely prepared
from eugenol, a constituent of oil
of cloves.</p>
<p>Vanillin seems to have some special action
upon the nervous system, and has
been employed in the treatment of hysteria.
It is also used to disguise disagreeable
tastes and odors of medicines, as
in lozenges and mixtures. Its principal use
is that of spice for flavoring chocolate,
confectionery, ices, ice-cream, drinks,
pastry; in the preparation of perfumery,
sachet powders, etc. It has a very pleasant,
delicate aroma when properly diluted
and can be very effectively combined
with other odors. Vanilla, combined
with almonds, simulates heliotrope.</p>
<p>The poisonous effects of ice creams
flavored with vanilla are perhaps not due
to vanillin, but to toxins formed by bacteria
found upon vanilla pods, or the bacteria
of the milk and cream used.</p>
